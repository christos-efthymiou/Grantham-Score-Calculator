# Grantham-Score-Calculator
Calculating the Grantham score is a great way to understand the effects of an amino acid mutation on a protein.

However, since the publication of the amino acid substitution scores in 1974, no automated way to calculate the scores had been developed.

This left individuals to search in a table to find the score for each amino acid substitution manually.

This is extremely time consuming and impossible when evaluating hundreds of mutations.

Therefore, I have created a Streamlit app so anyone can easily calculate the Grantham scores for missense mutations. You can access it here for free https://grantham-score-calculator-by-christos-efthymiou.streamlitapp.com/.
